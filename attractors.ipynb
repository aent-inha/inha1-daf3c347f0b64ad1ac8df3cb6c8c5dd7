    "[Clifford attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor) are a type of iterative equation that traces the path of a particle through a 2D space using functions of sine and cosine terms that make interesting \"attractor\" patterns (covering only some portions of the possible space, in certain shapes). \n",

    "Here we use Numpy and Pandas to calculate a dataframe consisting of millions of such locations, using [Numba](numba.pydata.org) to make generating them 50X faster than bare Python. We'll then plot the results as a static image using [Datashader](http://datashader.org), which renders arbitrarily large data into fixed-sized images."
